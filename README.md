# NFC Hot Potato game
I created this project as a way to explore NFC features in Android. 

The goal is to make an NFC implementation of the game [Hot potato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_potato_(game)), but instead of
tossing a ball, you pass an NFC message from one phone to another. To start the game you need to pick up
the "potato" by reading data from a NFC tag.
